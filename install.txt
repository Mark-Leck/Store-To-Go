Store To Go - Install intructions:

Upload the contents of this folder (as is) to the <root> Directory of your server.
Make sure that the <shop> Directory (ONLY) has Read & Write permissions set for IIS_IUSRS.
Make sure that the File <shop/includes/cfg.asp> has Read & Write permissions set for IIS_IUSRS.
If you can not change the permissions yourself then contact your server support Admin and request these changes.

Once installed visit the Admin login page at http:YourDomain.com/shop/includes/admin/login.asp.

Login using the following details:
